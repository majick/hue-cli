hue-cli
=======

Command Line Interface to the Philips Hue lighting system.  It was abandoned upstream, and I needed to fix a crash.

# Installation
To begin using, install the ruby gem (this requires ruby 1.9 and rubygems)

```
$ gem install hue-cli
```

This will install the "hue" command.

# Usage

To check the bridge state, simply type 

```
$ hue
```

If this is the first time the command is run, it will scan for bridges on the network and attempt to register the application. Follow the on-screen instructions to do so.

## Register

You can also explicity register the application with

```
$ hue register
```

## Bridge state

Once registered, examine the current state of the bridge.

```
$ hue

```

### Find new lights.

```

## Light state

Examine the state of a single light

```
$ hue light 1
```

or just 

```
$ hue 1
1.  Bedroom - Overhead: ON
    Brightness: 254 (100%)
    Color: XY=[0.6736, 0.3221], RGB\u2248[255, 60, 40]
```

### Change Light state

Change a single light state with the follow (rather self-explanatory) commands

```
$ hue 1 on
$ hue 1 off
$ hue 1 flash
$ hue 1 blink
$ hue 1 solid
```

### Brightness

Brightness can be set with a value (0-255) or percentage (0%-100%)

```
$ hue 1 brightness 200
$ hue 1 brightness 50%
$ hue 1
Living Overhead: ON
Brightness: 128 (50%)
Color: Temperature=2012°K (497 mired), RGB≈[255, 136, 13]
```

### Color

The color command takes 1-3 arguments, each interpreted depending on range and value.

Set to 6500 Kelvin.

```
$ hue 1 color 6500 
$ hue 1
Living Overhead: ON
Brightness: 128 (50%)
Color: Temperature=6500°K (153 mired), RGB≈[255, 254, 250]
```

Set to 240 mired.

```
$ hue 1 color 240
$ hue 1
Living Overhead: ON
Brightness: 128 (50%)
Color: Temperature=4167°K (240 mired), RGB≈[255, 208, 170]
```

Set the hue and saturation.

```
$ hue 1 color 30000 255
$ hue 1
Living Overhead: ON
Brightness: 128 (50%)
Color: Hue=30000, Saturation=255, RGB≈[0, 255, 190]
```

Set the XY

```
$ hue 1 color 0.25 0.25
$ hue 1
Living Overhead: ON
Brightness: 128 (50%)
Color: Hue=30000, Saturation=255, RGB≈[0, 255, 190]
```
## Set all lights.

All the single light state commands can be applied to all lights.

```
$ hue lights brightness 50%
```

## State aliases.

The following state aliases exist and can be used on all or single lights.

```
$ hue 1 relax
$ hue lights energize
$ hue 1 reading
$ hue 1 concentrate
$ hue 1 red
$ hue 1 blue
$ hue 1 green
$ hue 1 white
$ hue 1 pink
```

## State Dump

Dump the current state of the light, this will display the current state as a JSON hash.
This can then be pasted into your local (~/.hue-cli/light_alias.yml) or system (/etc/hue/light_alias.yml) alias files.

```
$ hue 1 dump
$ hue lights dump
```
Paste into your file like this:

```
"yellow": {"on":true,"bri":254,"xy":[0.4823,0.4621],"alert":"none","effect":"none"}
```
